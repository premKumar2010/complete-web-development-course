    The Bone Wars were rivalries between paleontologists, mainly Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh
    (pictured), that led to a surge of fossil discoveries during the Gilded Age of American history. Cope, of the
    Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and Marsh, of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale, competed
    using underhanded methods, resorting to bribery, theft, destruction of bones, and mutual attacks in scientific
    publications. They sought fossils in rich bone beds in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. From 1877 to 1892, they used
    their wealth and influence to finance their own expeditions and to procure services and dinosaur bones from fossil
    hunters. Cope and Marsh were financially and socially ruined by their attempts to disgrace each other, but their
    contributions to science and the field of paleontology, including many unopened boxes of fossils found after their
    deaths, were massive. Their efforts led to many new descriptions of dinosaur species, of which 32 remain valid
    today. The Bone Wars shed light on prehistoric life and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to
    continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow.

    India, officially the Republic of India (Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[e] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest
    country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in
    the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal
    on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast;
    and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the
    Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

    The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following
    millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on
    caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took
    place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; the later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as
    southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged,
    all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi sultanate; the south was united
    under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th
    century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British crown rule.
    A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent
    resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.

    In 2015, the Indian economy was the world's seventh largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power
    parity.[16] Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies
    and is considered a newly industrialised country. However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty,
    corruption, malnutrition, and inadequate public healthcare. A nuclear weapons state and regional power, it has the
    third largest standing army in the world and ranks fifth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal
    republic governed under a parliamentary system and consists of 29 states and 7 union territories. It is a
    pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society and is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of
    protected habitats.
